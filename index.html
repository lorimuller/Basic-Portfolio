        <p>I'm born and raised in Los Angeles....we're a rare breed. I currently live in Culver City with my 11 year old son, Milo.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love to travel. I've been to every continent but one. My son, by the age of 9, had already visited 3 continents.
          I've lived all throughout California, Seattle, and Chicago. I've also had an opportunity to live in Vancouver, Canada and Dublin, Ireland.
          I'm excited to see where life will take us next!
